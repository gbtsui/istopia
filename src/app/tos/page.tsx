                <p>
                    you're free to write whatever you want. but not every story is appropriate to share here. istopia is
                    meant for
                    meaningful and respectful storytelling and that means we don't allow anything that doesn't fit that
                    category.
                    as a general rule, stuff that falls into these categories isn't allowed:
                </p>
                <ul className={"text-sm"}>
                    <li>pornographic material (keep things mostly sfw!)</li>
                    <li>hate speech</li>
                    <li>degrading content</li>
                    <li>excessively gory or bloody content</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
